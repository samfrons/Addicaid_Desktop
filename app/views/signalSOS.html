        <h3>A Quote From The Pros</h3>
        <blockquote>
            When you begin, it's a man takes a drink. When you end up, it's a drink takes a man. Keeping my balance during that period was tricky. <br/><br/>&nbsp;When I was in my twenties, I thought I was invincible, made out of rubber. You skate along the straight razor and flirt with it all the time.<br/><br/>&nbsp;I've been sober now for nine years; the best thing I ever did apart from getting married. Was it hard to quit? No, the hard part was before I quit. This is the easy part."
